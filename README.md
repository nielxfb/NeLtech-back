# NeLtech Back-End

This repository contains a back-end web application built using Laravel.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Composer installed. If not, you can download it from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/). Then, install the PHP dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary values for your environment (e.g., database credentials, application keys).

### 3. Run the Laravel Application

Start the Laravel development server:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

By default, the Laravel app will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
